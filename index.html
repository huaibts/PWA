							<h2>LUXO JR</h2>
							<p>A baby lamp finds a ball to play with and it's all fun and games until the ball bursts. Just when the elder Luxo thinks his kid will settle down for a bit, Luxo Jr. finds another ball—ten times larger.</p>
							<p>"Luxo Jr." has a great parent in the larger lamp. Even though Jr. is a bit unpredictable, the elder Luxo gives him room to grow and explore. And the tiny light has no problem with that.</p>
							<p>When John Lasseter was learning how to make models, he chose the nearest, easiest subject: an architect's lamp sitting on his desk. He started moving it around in the animation system like it was alive, and it eventually became a Pixar short that was nominated for an Academy Award®.</p>
